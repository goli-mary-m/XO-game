# XO game

The XO game (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

## How to play

In each turn, the player enters a location number (a number between 1 and 9).

1 | 2 | 3

4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9

The first player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
